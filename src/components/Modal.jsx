                <b>Brief History</b>
              </h5>
              <p>
                <b>Getting Killed And Injured (GKAI)</b> is a logical game
                between 2 players in which each player select
                <b>4</b> random numbers between <b>1 - 9</b> with no repeated
                number. Each player tries to guess correctly the other player's
                4 random number in order of appearance.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a game I played very well with pen and paper during my
                childhood among friends, family and adults alike. Everybody
                loved the game because it's challenging and it involves critical
                use of logic.
              </p>
              <p>
                I recently came across the game in an old diary which I do use
                to play the game back then and I thought about making it
                available online for everyone to play.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <b>How To Play</b>
              </h5>
              <p>
                The actual concept of the game is built for
                <b>2</b> players, but in this case, a user will try to get the 4
                randomly generated numbers by the computer in the right order.
              </p>
              <h6>
                <b>
                  The aim is to get the computer's numbers in the right order.
                </b>
              </h6>
              <h6>
                <b>Instructions:</b>
              </h6>
              <p>
                You enter any 4 different numbers between <b>1 - 9</b> in the
                four input areas provided. The first box for the first guessed
                number, the second for the second number and so on then click
                the submit button.
              </p>
              <p>
                The system then compares the numbers you put down with the
                computer's number and tells you how many number(s) got injured
                and how many got killed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you get an injured, that means a number is correct but
                wrongly placed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you get a killed that means that you got the number right, in
                the exact position.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, Let's say the computer-generated numbers are
                <b> 2 9 8 1</b> and you entered
                <b>7 2 9 1. The result will return 2 injured and 1 killed,</b>
                it means you have 3 numbers correct but 2 numbers wrongly placed
                and 1 number in the exact position. In this case, 2, 9 and 1 are
                correct but only 1 is killed (in the right order) while 2 and 9
                are injured (correct but wrongly placed).
              </p>
              <p>
                So the deal is you have to keep placing guesses of different
                numbers from <b>1 - 9</b> in the 4 boxes and submit to tell you
                how many killed and how many injured.
              </p>
              <p>
                You do this till you get 4 killed meaning you got all numbers
                right and in the exact position.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>PS</b> You use results of previous guesses to try to figure
                out all the right numbers in the right order.
              </p>
              <p>
                The computer numbers is a fixed number, but changes anytime you
                wanna play.
              </p>
